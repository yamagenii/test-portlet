/**
* <p>The StateManagerService is a service that manages SessionState information.
* Each SessionState is identified by a unique key in this service.  The SessionState
* is composed of name - value sets of attributes, stored under the key by the service.</p>
* <p>See the proposal: jakarta-jetspeed/proposals/StateManager.txt for more details.</p>
* <p>Attribute values placed into SessionStates may be automatically removed, for example when
* a SessionState expires in some way, or by means of some other automatic service.  These value
* objects can be notified of their placement into and out of the SessionState.  Objects that wish
* to receive this notification implement the SessionStateBindingListener interface.  This is based
* on and similar to the HttpSessionBindingListener mechanism.</p>
* <p>To support the "current" routines; the ability to get a session state based
* on the current http session, this service must be installed properly into the
* procssing of each http request.  At the start of the request, the HttpSession
* of the request must be passed into the setCurrentContext() method.  At the end
* of the request, clearCurrentContext() is called.  For Jetspeed, this is done in
* the JetspeedRunDataService, which is always going to be called by Turbine in this
* way.</p>
